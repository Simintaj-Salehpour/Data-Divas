Our team chose to examine differences in hospital length of stay across insurance types because it highlights an important intersection between healthcare access, cost, and patient outcomes.The relationship between insurance coverage and hospital utilization is central to understanding disparities in care delivery and efficiency within the U.S. healthcare system. We were particularly interested in comparing Medicare, which primarily serves older adults, and Private Insurance, which often provides broader access to care, to see how coverage type influences hospital resource use. Members of our team who have personally dealt with Medicaid and have seen firsthand how insurance status can impact the quality, timing, and length of medical care also find personal significance in this topic. We sought to better understand how insurance differences translate into quantifiable healthcare outcomes by combining our personal viewpoints with data-driven evidence through the analysis of actual hospital discharge data.
